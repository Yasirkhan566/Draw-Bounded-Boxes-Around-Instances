# Draw-Bounded-Boxes-Around-Instances
This code shows that how you can draw bounded boxes to visualize the images after instance detection. This code draws boundaries around the objects. 
<h2>Note:</h2>
<p>This code does not detect instances. It takes the bounded boxes from user and draws them on the input image. These bounded boxes user may have detected using any object detection model.</p>
<h2>Input:</h2>
<p>Bounded Boxes in COCO Format or YOLO Format</p>
<p>Image on which you want to draw the bounded boxes</p>

<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Image with overlayed boundary around the instances</p>
